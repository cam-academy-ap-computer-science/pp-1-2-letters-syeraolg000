Good work!  Your program is very clean and well-organized.

One of the requirements was that the main method have only
three functions in it, one for each letter.  I'm not sure
you knew that requirement, and you did demonstrate that
you know how to use a shared method for the various letters,
so I'll take off just one point for that.

For future projects, you will want to start adding comments.
Everybody does comments slightly differently, but at a minimum
it would have been good to have a comment for the methods that
were letters and the method that was a share paragraph, or in
your long main, to have comments separating the various letters.
